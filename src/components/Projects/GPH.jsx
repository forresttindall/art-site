          General Purpose Human is an ongoing art project about cultivating the spirit of the polymath in a world obsessed with specialization. It rejects the pressure to narrow down and instead embraces curiosity as a discipline and mastery as a lifelong pursuit. Inspired by makers and thinkers like Van Neistat, Tom Sachs, and Braxton Haugan, the project treats life itself as a studio where craft, philosophy, and daily practice come together.
<br />
<br />
At its core, General Purpose Human explores what it means to live with breadth and depth at the same time: to weld steel and write poems, to study machines and paint portraits, to build knowledge across domains not as distraction but as an integrated way of being. It is a manifesto against compartmentalization and a celebration of fluid identity, where art, craft, science, and storytelling are not separate pursuits but parts of the same human continuum.
<br />
<br />
Through mixed media, journaling, photography, and object-making, the project documents this journey. It reminds us that to be a general purpose human is not to lack focus but to choose wholeness over reduction and curiosity over conformity.
