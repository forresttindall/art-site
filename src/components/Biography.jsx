  J F Tindall is a general purpose human born in Boise, Idaho, and raised in the expansive landscapes of the American West. He began making art at an early age, first through drawing and writing, then discovering film photography at the age of 13. His work explores the intersection of place, identity, and the stories we tell ourselves about belonging. Through photography, writing, illustration, and mixed media, he documents the quiet contradictions of contemporary life, the spaces between what we call things and what they actually are.

  In 2013, Tindall launched <em>Tindall Knives</em>, beginning his career as a knifemaker. This practice of shaping steel by hand eventually drew him deeper into solitude and craft, leading him north into the mountains, where he lived as a hermit knifemaker for eight years. That period of retreat became a crucible for patience, discipline, and attention to detail, qualities that continue to inform his creative practice today.

<br />
<p className="mono-text">
  His practice is rooted in observation and patience, finding meaning in the mundane and beauty in the overlooked. Whether capturing the stark honesty of small-town architecture or exploring what it means to be human, he is drawn to the gaps between expectation and experience.
</p>
<br />
<p className="mono-text">
  Currently based in Mountain Home, Idaho, he continues to investigate the relationship between landscape and language, using various media to question how we construct meaning from the places we inhabit. His work has been featured in regional exhibitions and global publications, always seeking to bridge the distance between the personal and the universal.

  When not creating, Tindall can be found wandering the high desert, collecting stories and coordinates, building the discipline of creation one frame, one word, one moment at a time.
